  <header class="content">
    <center>Stephen Hawking was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author who was one of the most renowned scientists of his time. <br>
    He was born on January 8, 1942, in Oxford, England, and passed away on March 14, 2018, at the age of 76.<br>
    Hawking was diagnosed with a form of motor neurone disease in 1963 and was given just two years to live.<br>
    Despite this prognosis, he went on to live for more than 50 years, becoming one of the world's most famous scientists<br>
     and a symbol of the triumph of the human spirit over adversity.

      Some of his achievements include:<br>
      <br>
      1. Developing the theory of cosmological inflation: <br>
      Hawking was the first to propose that the universe underwent a rapid expansion in the first fraction of a second after the Big Bang.<br><br>

      2. Discovering the second law of black hole dynamics:<br> Hawking showed that black holes emit radiation, now known as Hawking radiation, which eventually causes them to evaporate.<br><br>

      3. Contributed to the understanding of black hole singularities: <br>Hawking helped prove the existence of singularities, which are points in space-time where the laws of physics break down, at the centers of black holes.<br><br>

      4. Writing popular science books: <br>Hawking was a prolific writer, authoring several books on science and cosmology, including the best-selling "A Brief History of Time".<br><br>

      5. Receiving numerous awards and honors: <br>Throughout his career, Hawking received many awards and honors, including being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 and being made a Companion of Honour in 1989.<br><br>
